# Security

`juno` rests on three guarantees: a **no-train privacy posture**, a **workspace
jail** on every file tool, and an **interactive permission gate** in front of risky
tool calls. This document states each as it is actually built.

## Privacy model — no-train only

**The whole policy is NO-TRAIN.** There is no geographic / "Western-only"
allowlist; that screen was retired. juno never adds an `only: [...]` provider
allowlist.

No-train is enforced **account-side on OpenRouter** (project decision D2). The
account's OpenRouter data policy is the source of truth. On top of that, the
adapter adds a **belt-and-suspenders** directive in the request body.

### How it is applied

In `src/providers/openaiCompatClient.ts`, when the request targets OpenRouter the
adapter attaches:

```js
body.provider = {
  data_collection: 'deny',
  allow_fallbacks: true,
};
```

This block is **identity-keyed**: it is gated on the `isOpenRouter` flag, which is
derived from the catalog entry's provider id (`entry.provider === 'openrouter'`),
**not** by string-matching the base URL. A custom or trailing-slash OpenRouter base
URL still routes correctly, and a non-OpenRouter base URL is never accidentally
tagged. Note there is **no `only: [...]` allowlist** — `data_collection: 'deny'` is
the entire body-level directive.

### API keys

API keys are never stored, logged, or emitted by juno. The config layer
(`src/services/config.ts`) only records the **name** of an environment variable
(`providers[*].apiKeyEnv`); the value is read by the provider adapter **inside
`streamTurn`, at request time**, sent in the `Authorization` / `x-api-key` header,
and otherwise never persisted.

### Advisory verifier (not enforcement)

`scripts/verify-openrouter-policy.ts` is an **optional, secondary,
non-enforcing** convenience check, run standalone:

```sh
npx tsx scripts/verify-openrouter-policy.ts
```

It never sits in the request hot path and never gates a request. It checks whether
`OPENROUTER_API_KEY` is set and (best-effort) that the key resolves against the
OpenRouter `/key` endpoint, then prints an advisory message to stderr and exits 0/1.
It is skippable via `--skip` or `JUNO_SKIP_POLICY_CHECK=1`. Every message it prints
is framed as "secondary / not enforcement" so it can never be mistaken for the
account-side enforcement. The key is sent in-memory only and is never printed.

## Tool sandbox — the workspace jail

Every file tool (`src/tools/fileTools.ts`) confines all filesystem access to a
**jail root** equal to the resolved working directory (`ctx.cwd`, from
`settings.cwd` / `JUNO_CWD`). Before any read or write, the requested path is passed
through `resolveInWorkspace(cwd, targetPath)`:

```
root     = path.resolve(cwd)
resolved = path.resolve(root, targetPath)
rel      = path.relative(root, resolved)
reject if  rel === '..'  ||  rel startsWith '..' + sep  ||  path.isAbsolute(rel)
```

Guarantees this gives:

- **No `..` escape.** A relative path that climbs above the root yields a `rel`
  beginning with `..` and is rejected (`"path escapes workspace"`).
- **No absolute-path escape.** An absolute target outside the root resolves to a
  `rel` that is itself absolute and is rejected.
- **Cross-drive escape (Windows).** When the target is on a different drive than the
  root (e.g. `C:\` vs `D:\`), `path.relative` returns an absolute path, so the same
  `isAbsolute(rel)` guard catches it.
- The root itself is allowed (`rel === ''`, e.g. `list_files(".")`).

Additional containment properties:

- **Shell (`run_shell`) is the most-gated tool.** The registry
  (`src/tools/registry.ts`) exposes a `run_shell` tool (`src/tools/shellTool.ts`)
  that runs a command line via `sh -c` (no interactive/login profile,
  `shell:false`, stdin closed). It is `risk:'dangerous'`, so the permission policy
  **always prompts** for it in **both** `default` and `acceptEdits` modes — it is
  never auto-approved by risk alone. The prompt for a **dangerous** tool
  deliberately does **not** offer `[a]` (always allow): the remembered pattern
  would be the bare tool name, which matches *every* future call, so one `a` on a
  benign command would blanket-grant all commands forever. Only an explicit
  `dangerous-bypass` (`!`) can pre-grant it — and the policy **structurally
  refuses** to satisfy dangerous risk from an ordinary `always-allow-pattern`
  rule even when a matching one exists (defense in depth against a UI
  regression).

  **The workspace jail does NOT constrain the shell.** The child's `cwd` merely
  *starts* at the workspace root; a command can `cd` anywhere or touch absolute
  paths outside it freely. cwd is a starting directory, not confinement — the
  per-command permission prompt (which shows the exact command string) is the
  control.

  **Sanitized environment.** The child env is built from an allowlist — `PATH`,
  `HOME`, `USER`, `LOGNAME`, `SHELL`, `LANG`, `LANGUAGE`, `TMPDIR`, `TERM`,
  `COLORTERM`, plus any `LC_*` locale variables (`SHELL_ENV_ALLOWLIST` in
  `src/tools/shellTool.ts`). Everything else — `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` /
  `OPENAI_API_KEY` / `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, tokens, juno's own `JUNO_*` config —
  is withheld, so a shell command can never read juno's secrets from its
  environment.

  Output is capped (default 100 KiB per stream, truncation-marked) and the child
  is killed (SIGTERM→SIGKILL) after a hard timeout (default 120s). A non-zero
  exit is a tool error, not a crash. It is a **parent-agent-only** capability
  (excluded from the sub-agent tool snapshot, like the memory tools). `run_shell`
  is a **juno-internal** tool: it has no `JUNO_TO_CLI_TOOL` mapping, so on the
  **`claude-cli` backend** it is never projected onto `--allowedTools`, and that
  backend's own `Bash` stays unconditionally on `--disallowedTools`. The five file
  tools remain the only *other* tools that touch the filesystem. On the
  **`claude-cli` backend** (the default), the spawned `claude -p` runs its *own*
  tools within the invocation, so juno's executor cannot intercept them
  individually. That backend is instead constrained up front
  (`src/providers/claudeCliClient.ts`, `buildCliToolGrants`). What this **does**
  guarantee, per turn:
  - The child is spawned with `cwd` pinned to the jail root.
  - `--allowedTools` pre-approves **only** the CLI tools whose juno mirror the
    permission policy would *auto-allow in the live mode*: the read-only tools
    (`read_file→Read`, `list_files→Glob`, `grep→Grep`) always, and the write
    tools (`write_file→Write`, `edit_file→Edit`) **only in `acceptEdits` mode**.
    Every allow entry is **path-scoped** to the jail root as `Tool(//<jailroot>/**)`
    (gitignore-style absolute pattern), so a pre-approval never covers a path
    outside the jail.
  - `--disallowedTools` **unconditionally** denies the shell/network/sub-agent
    tools (`Bash`, `BashOutput`, `KillShell`, `WebFetch`, `WebSearch`, `Task`),
    and in juno **`default` mode** *also* denies `Write`/`Edit` — juno would
    prompt a human for those, and a headless `claude -p` cannot prompt, so they
    are hard-denied rather than silently auto-approved (the original bypass).
  - A deny rule wins over any allow rule, so the denied set — and the
    default-mode `Write`/`Edit` denial — cannot be re-enabled by a user's
    `~/.claude` config. Any tool or path not pre-approved is denied headlessly
    in `-p` mode (no prompter exists to fall back to).

  What this **does not** guarantee: this is defense-by-configuration of the
  child process, **not** a kernel/OS-level jail. It relies on Claude Code
  honoring its own permission-rule engine; a bug there would not be contained by
  juno. juno does **not** pass `--setting-sources`, so the user's own
  `~/.claude` settings still load. Because deny wins over allow this cannot widen
  the denied set, but the read tools (`Read`/`Glob`/`Grep`) are *not* on the deny
  list, so a user's pre-existing global *allow* rule for one of them (e.g. an
  unscoped `Read`) could still widen reads beyond the jail. The `cwd` pin and
  path-scoped grants bound what **juno itself** pre-authorizes; they do not
  revoke a broader grant the user configured globally. Passing
  `--setting-sources project,local` would close this, but is omitted to avoid
  disturbing the subscription OAuth/user configuration the backend depends on.
- **Tools never throw to the caller.** Filesystem errors are returned as
  `{ ok: false, error }`, so a bad path or missing file cannot crash a turn.
- **`grep` is ReDoS-safe by default.** Matching is literal-substring (linear time)
  unless `regex: true` is explicitly passed; an invalid user regex falls back to
  literal substring rather than throwing. The recursive walk skips `node_modules`
  and dot-directories and honors the abort signal.

## Permission gate

Risky tool calls cannot run without an explicit decision. Tools declare a
`RiskLevel`: `read_file`/`list_files`/`grep` are `safe`; `write_file`/`edit_file`
are `risky`. The pure policy in `src/permissions/policy.ts` decides via
`evaluate(name, args, risk)`:

- **Remembered rules win first**, evaluated in deny-over-allow order: a matching
  `deny` rule → `auto-deny`; otherwise a matching `dangerous-bypass` →
  `auto-allow`; otherwise a matching `always-allow-pattern` → `auto-allow` **only
  for non-`dangerous` risk**. A `dangerous` call is never satisfied by an
  ordinary always-allow rule — only an explicit `dangerous-bypass` pre-grants it.
- **Otherwise the risk fallback applies:** `safe` → `auto-allow` (when
  `autoAllowSafe`, the default); `risky` → `prompt`; `dangerous` → `prompt`. A
  `dangerous` call is **never** silently auto-allowed by risk alone — only an
  explicit remembered bypass pre-grants it.

When `evaluate` returns `prompt`, the executor opens the interactive
`PermissionPrompt`, which offers four decisions (keys `y` / `a` / `d` / `!`).
For a **`dangerous`** tool the `a` binding is disabled and hidden — only
`y` / `d` / `!` are offered (see the `run_shell` bullet above for why):

| Key | Decision                 | Effect                                              |
| --- | ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `y` | `allow-once`             | Run this call only; never remembered.               |
| `a` | `always-allow-pattern`   | Run, and remember an allow rule for this tool.      |
| `d` | `deny`                   | Do not run; emit a terminal `tool-status('error')`. |
| `!` | `dangerous-bypass`       | Run, and remember a bypass rule for this tool.      |

A `deny` decision means the tool is not run. The full async mechanics of the prompt
(the park/resolve registry, the single shared policy instance, the drain-on-abort
guarantee) are documented in [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md#the-permission-round-trip).

### Always-allow pattern grammar

Remembered rules are matched against a stable key `"<toolName>:<salient>"`, where
`salient` is the call's `path` (or `dir`) argument when present, else the empty
string (`src/permissions/patterns.ts`). Pattern rules:

- A **bare tool name** with no `:` is normalized to `tool:*`, so it matches any
  call to that tool.
- `*` is the **only** glob metacharacter; every other regex metacharacter is
  escaped. A `*` matches any run of characters **including newlines** (`[\s\S]*`),
  so a `deny tool:*` rule cannot be evaded by an argument containing a line break.
- Matching is anchored to the full key (`^…$`).

## Local data

Local persistence is opt-in and modest. Sessions live under
`~/.config/juno/sessions/`; memory is a bounded (default 64 KiB) key/value file at
`~/.config/juno/memory/memory.json`. No secrets are written to these stores — they
hold transcript messages and user-supplied memory values only.
